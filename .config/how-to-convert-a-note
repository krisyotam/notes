Here. A blunt conversion guide between **Markdown (.md)** and **Org mode (.org)**, with **separate sections** and a **comment that explains what it is**. Humans really did invent two mostly-identical plain-text formats and then argued about them for decades.

---

## 1) Headings

# Comment: Document structure (sections/subsections).

**Markdown**

```md
# Title
## Section
### Subsection
#### Subsubsection
```

**Org**

```org
* Title
** Section
*** Subsection
**** Subsubsection
```

**Convert**

* `#` → `*`
* `##` → `**`
* etc. (same depth, different symbol)

---

## 2) Paragraphs and Line Breaks

# Comment: Plain text blocks; how “new lines” behave.

**Markdown**

* New paragraph = blank line.
* Single newline is usually ignored (depends on renderer).
* Hard break: end line with two spaces or use `<br>`.

```md
Line one  
Line two
```

**Org**

* New paragraph = blank line.
* A single newline is usually a newline (but export can reflow).
* Hard break: use `\\` at end of line in some exports, or just keep line breaks.

```org
Line one\\
Line two
```

**Convert**

* Keep blank lines the same.
* Replace Markdown’s two-space hard break with Org `\\` only if you truly need forced breaks on export.

---

## 3) Bold / Italic / Underline / Strike

# Comment: Inline emphasis.

**Markdown**

```md
**bold**
*italic*
~~strikethrough~~
```

**Org**

```org
*bold*
/italic/
+strikethrough+
_underline_
```

**Convert**

* `**bold**` → `*bold*`
* `*italic*` or `_italic_` → `/italic/`
* `~~strike~~` → `+strike+`
* Underline isn’t standard in Markdown, but in Org it’s `_underline_`.

---

## 4) Inline Code

# Comment: Mark text as code inline.

**Markdown**

```md
Use `printf()` here
```

**Org**

```org
Use =printf()= here
```

**Convert**

* `` `code` `` → `=code=`
* Org also supports `~code~` for code-ish style; `=` is the usual.

---

## 5) Code Blocks (fenced)

# Comment: Multi-line code with an optional language tag.

**Markdown**

````md
```python
print("hi")
````

````

**Org**
```org
#+begin_src python
print("hi")
#+end_src
````

**Convert**

* ```lang → `#+begin_src lang`
* ``` → `#+end_src`

---

## 6) Blockquotes

# Comment: Quoted text / callouts.

**Markdown**

```md
> quoted line
> another line
```

**Org**

```org
#+begin_quote
quoted line
another line
#+end_quote
```

**Convert**

* `>` blocks → `#+begin_quote ... #+end_quote`

---

## 7) Lists (unordered / ordered)

# Comment: Bullet and numbered lists.

**Markdown**

```md
- a
  - nested
* also works in some renderers

1. one
2. two
```

**Org**

```org
- a
  - nested

1. one
2. two
```

**Convert**

* Mostly identical.
* Org nesting is indentation-based like Markdown.

---

## 8) Task Lists / Checkboxes

# Comment: Track tasks and completion states.

**Markdown**

```md
- [ ] todo
- [x] done
```

**Org**

```org
- [ ] todo
- [X] done
```

**Convert**

* Same concept, Org prefers `X` but accepts `x` in practice.

---

## 9) Org TODO keywords (extra power)

# Comment: Org has built-in task states beyond checkboxes.

**Org**

```org
* TODO Write draft
* NEXT Edit
* DONE Publish
```

**Markdown equivalent**

* No native standard. People fake it with text or checkboxes.

**Convert**

* If your Markdown has conventions like `- [ ]` under a heading, you can optionally elevate to Org’s `* TODO` headings.

---

## 10) Links

# Comment: Clickable references.

**Markdown**

```md
[text](https://example.com)
https://example.com
```

**Org**

```org
[[https://example.com][text]]
[[https://example.com]]
```

**Convert**

* `[text](url)` → `[[url][text]]`
* bare URL → `[[url]]` (optional; Org auto-detects many URLs anyway)

---

## 11) Images

# Comment: Embedded images (display varies by editor/export).

**Markdown**

```md
![alt text](./img.png)
```

**Org**

```org
[[./img.png]]
```

**Convert**

* `![alt](path)` → `[[path]]`
* Org doesn’t store “alt text” the same way; if you care, add a caption:

```org
#+caption: alt text
[[./img.png]]
```

---

## 12) Horizontal Rules

# Comment: Section breaks.

**Markdown**

```md
---
```

**Org**

```org
-----
```

**Convert**

* `---` → `-----` (Org tends to like 5+ dashes)

---

## 13) Tables

# Comment: Structured data tables.

**Markdown**

```md
| a | b |
|---|---|
| 1 | 2 |
```

**Org**

```org
| a | b |
|---+---|
| 1 | 2 |
```

**Convert**

* Replace the separator row `|---|---|` with `|---+---|` style.
* Org also supports alignment lines and spreadsheet-like formulas.

---

## 14) Footnotes

# Comment: References/endnotes.

**Markdown (common style)**

```md
This is a claim.[^1]

[^1]: Footnote text.
```

**Org**

```org
This is a claim.[fn:1]

[fn:1] Footnote text.
```

**Convert**

* `[^1]` → `[fn:1]`
* `[^1]: ...` → `[fn:1] ...`

---

## 15) “Callouts” / Admonitions

# Comment: Notes, warnings, tips. Markdown has many dialects; Org uses blocks.

**Markdown (varies by engine)**

```md
> [!NOTE]
> Something important.
```

**Org**

```org
#+begin_quote
NOTE: Something important.
#+end_quote
```

**Convert**

* There’s no single universal mapping; simplest is quote blocks with labels.
* If you export with Org to HTML/LaTeX, you can also use special blocks:

```org
#+begin_note
Something important.
#+end_note
```

(Works depending on your exporter/setup.)

---

## 16) Frontmatter / Metadata

# Comment: Markdown often uses YAML frontmatter; Org uses `#+KEY:` lines.

**Markdown**

```md
---
title: My Note
tags: [a, b]
date: 2026-01-16
---
```

**Org**

```org
#+title: My Note
#+date: 2026-01-16
#+filetags: :a:b:
```

**Convert**

* `title` → `#+title:`
* `date` → `#+date:`
* `tags` → `#+filetags: :a:b:`

---

## 17) Comments

# Comment: Hidden notes not meant for export.

**Markdown**

* No real standard. Some use HTML:

```md
<!-- comment -->
```

**Org**

```org
# comment
# Another comment line
```

**Convert**

* `<!-- ... -->` → `# ...` (one-line) or multiple `#` lines.

---

## 18) Quick “Specific Thing” Conversions Cheat Sheet

# Comment: Copy/paste mapping list for common edits.

* `# Heading` → `* Heading`
* `## Heading` → `** Heading`
* `**bold**` → `*bold*`
* `*italic*` → `/italic/`
* `` `code` `` → `=code=`
* `~~strike~~` → `+strike+`
* `lang … ` → `#+begin_src lang … #+end_src`
* `> quote` → `#+begin_quote … #+end_quote`
* `[text](url)` → `[[url][text]]`
* `![alt](img.png)` → `#+caption: alt` + `[[img.png]]`
* `[^1]` → `[fn:1]`
* `---` → `-----`
* Markdown YAML frontmatter → `#+title:`, `#+date:`, `#+filetags:`

---

## 19) Pitfalls That Bite People (so you don’t)

# Comment: Things that break when you “mechanically” convert.

* Org emphasis markers (like `*bold*`) can fail if they touch letters/punctuation weirdly; add spaces if needed.
* Nested lists + code blocks: Org wants code blocks aligned under list indentation if they’re “inside” a list item.
* Markdown links inside parentheses sometimes look uglier in Org; it’s normal.
* Markdown “callouts” are not standardized; expect manual cleanup.

---

If you want, paste a small Markdown sample (like 30–80 lines) and I’ll convert it to Org cleanly in one go, including tags/title/footnotes, without doing the “well it depends” dance.
