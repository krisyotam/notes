#+title: Definition of Absolute Value
#+filetags: :algebra:absolute-value:

The absolute value of a number represents its distance from 0 on the
number line, regardless of direction.

It is defined piecewise as:
$$
|x| =
\begin{cases}
x, & \text{if } x \geq 0 \\
-x, & \text{if } x < 0
\end{cases}
$$
This means: - If $x$ is positive or zero, $|x| = x$ - If $x$ is
negative, $|x| = -x$ (which makes it positive)

Absolute value is often used in contexts involving: - Distance between
numbers - Inequalities (e.g., $|x - a| < \delta$ in limits) -
Piecewise definitions - Symmetry of graphs
