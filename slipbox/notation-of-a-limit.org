#+title: Notation of a Limit
#+filetags: :calculus:limits:

A limit describes what a function approaches as the input gets close to
a certain value. It's written as:
$$
\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = L
$$
This reads: "The limit of $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches $a$ is $L$."

Formally, it means: for every $\epsilon > 0$, there exists a
$\delta > 0$ such that if $0 < |x - a| < \delta$, then
$|f(x) - L| < \epsilon$.\\
This $\epsilon$-$\delta$ definition is the rigorous foundation of
limits, though intuitive understanding comes first.

Limits let us talk about function behavior near a point---even if
$f(a)$ is undefined. They are critical to defining continuity and
derivatives.
