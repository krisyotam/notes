#+title: Function Notation
#+filetags: :algebra:functions:

Function notation is a shorthand way to describe how a function maps
inputs to outputs.

The expression $f(x)$ means "the value of the function $f$ when the
input is $x$." It's a more descriptive way to write $y$ in terms of
$x$ and helps us deal with more complex expressions in calculus.

For example, if: \[
f(x) = 2x + 1,
\] this tells us that: - The function is named $f$ - For every input
$x$, the output is given by the rule $2x + 1$

So $f(3) = 2(3) + 1 = 7$.\\
This notation lets us plug in values, graph functions, and perform
operations on them.

In calculus, function notation is essential because we often study how
$f(x)$ changes with $x$---especially as $x$ gets close to some
value, which brings us to limits.
