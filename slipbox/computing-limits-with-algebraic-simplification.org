#+title: Computing Limits with Algebraic Simplification
#+filetags: :calculus:limits:

When direct substitution leads to an indeterminate form like
$\frac{0}{0}$, simplify the expression algebraically.

*Example:* \[
\lim_{x \to 3} \frac{x^2 - 9}{x - 3}
$$
Steps: 1. Factor the numerator: \[
\frac{(x - 3)(x + 3)}{x - 3}
\] 2. Cancel $(x - 3)$: \[
x + 3
\] 3. Plug in $x = 3$: \[
3 + 3 = 6
$$
The simplification resolves the indeterminate form and reveals the
limit.
