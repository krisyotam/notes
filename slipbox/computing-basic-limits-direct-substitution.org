#+title: Computing Basic Limits - Direct Substitution
#+filetags: :calculus:limits:

The easiest way to evaluate a limit is to directly plug in the value of
$x$.

*Example:* \[
\lim_{x \to 1} (3x + 2)
$$
- Plug in $x = 1$:\\
  $3(1) + 2 = 5$

Since there's no division by zero or undefined behavior, the limit is
just the function value at that point.

This method works when the function is continuous at the point you're
approaching.
