#+title: When a Limit Exists
#+filetags: :calculus:limits:

A limit $\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = L$ exists only if the function
approaches the same value from both sides:
$$
\lim_{x \to a^-} f(x) = L \quad \text{and} \quad \lim_{x \to a^+} f(x) = L
$$
- The *left-hand limit* ($x \to a^-$) looks at values from the left
- The *right-hand limit* ($x \to a^+$) looks at values from the right

If these two limits agree, the two-sided limit exists.\\
If they differ, the two-sided limit *does not exist* (DNE).

This is common at jump discontinuities or in absolute value functions
where behavior changes depending on direction.
